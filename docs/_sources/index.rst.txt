The CDot Programming Language
=============================

CDot is an object oriented language that was designed to feel familiar to everyone who already knows a language of the C family or any other modern language, such as Swift or Rust.

CDot programs are statically compiled and type-safe, which means that the types of every variable you declare need to be known at compile-time, which differentiates it from dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript. To ease the burden on developers, CDot supports powerful type inference, which means that you won't have to write many type annotations in practice.

It's good form to start of the documentation of any programming language by showing you how to print ``"Hello, World!"`` to the screen, so here's what that looks like in CDot::

    print("Hello, World! üåç")

With that out of the way, we can get started with the documentation!
